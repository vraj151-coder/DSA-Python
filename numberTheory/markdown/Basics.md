# Basic Math

## A.P  

- sum => $n/2(2*a+(n-1)d)$
- Tn => $a+(n-1)d$

## G.P

- sum => $a(r^n-1)/(r-1)$

- Tn => $ar^(n-1)$

## Quadratic Equation

$ ax^2 + bx + c = 0 $

$x=(-b+-\sqrt{b^2-4ac})/2a$

$ D=b^2-4ac$

- if D < 0 , root are imaginary
- if D = 0, two equal roots
- if D > 1, two distinct roots

## Mean

$\sum_{i=1}^n x_i/n$

## Median

Middle number,found by ordering all data points and picking out the one in middle (or if there are two middle numbers, taking mean of those two numbers)

## Prime

Divisible by 1 and itself

>Every prime number greater than 3 can be represented in the form of 6n+1 or 6n-1 but not vice versa,where n is natural number

## Factor

All number that divide a number completely (remainder is 0)

## Multiple

Number you get when you multiply a certain number by an integer

24 is completely divisible by 1,2,3,4,6,8,12,24
Each of these number is factor of 24 and 24 is multiple of each of these numbers

## LCM

Smallest number other than 0 that is multiple of each number
lcm of 4 and 6 is 12

## GCD or HCF

Highest number which exactly divides all numbers

HCF of 12 and 16 is 4

## Farenheight and Celcius

$F=C*(9/5) + 32$

## Factorial

$ n!=n*(n-1)*(n-2)*...1
0!=1

## Permutation

$P{N\choose r}=n!/(n-r)!$

## Combination

$C{N\choose k}=n!/r!(n-r)!$

## Leap Year Condition

  The year is multiple of 400.
  The year is multiple of 4 and not multiple of 100.

## Number of digits in number

> Floor(log<sub>10</sub>n)+1
